### ARRAY METHODS

1. **Array.prototype.pop()**
- This method removes the last element from an array and returns that element.  I like to think of it as 'popping off' the last item of an array.  This _will_ change the length of an array.

2. **Array.prototype.push()**
- This method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns new length.  I like to think of it as 'pushing' or adding an item to an array.

3. **Array.prototype.shift()**
- This method removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element.  Literally 'shifting' or moving items in an array and in doing so you remove the first element.

4. **Array.prototype.unshift()**
- This method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns new length of an array.  I like to think of this as the opposite of the `.shift()` method.
